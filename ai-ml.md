# AI & Machine Learning Projects

This section highlights my hands-on work in applied machine learning and model development. My projects focus on practical implementations of deep learning and classical ML techniques, including image-based emotion recognition, text classification, feature engineering, and experiment tracking. Each project emphasizes reproducibility, clear evaluation metrics, and real-world applicability, with complete pipelines, artifacts, and documentation available in the linked repositories.

| Project | Overview | Tech Stack | Repo |
|---------|----------|------------|------|
| **Emotion Recognition (CNN)** | Convolutional neural network trained on labeled facial expressions with reproducible pipeline + artifact management. | TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, scikit-learn | [GitHub](https://github.com/Smittyman50/Emotion-Recognition-CNN) |
| **Text Emotion Classifier** | Classical ML with TF-IDF + MNB, model promotion using macro-F1 leaderboard. | Python, scikit-learn | [GitHub](https://github.com/Smittyman50/Text-Emotion-NB) |
