# Network & Infrastructure Automation

This section showcases my work in modern network engineering and infrastructure automation, with a focus on designing resilient architectures and simplifying operational complexity. Projects include Cisco and MikroTik configurations, VRRP and CAPsMAN high-availability designs, and end-to-end automation of Proxmox, Linux, and network devices using Terraform and Ansible. Each project emphasizes reliability, repeatability, and real-world applicability, reflecting my commitment to building networks that are scalable, observable, and automation-ready.
