### ðŸ§  About
With over 30 years of experience in IT, I am a technical leader who combines deep expertise in enterprise networking, cybersecurity, and cloud environments with a strategic, results-driven approach. My certificationsâ€”including CISSP, AWS, and PMP, along with former CCNP and CCDP credentialsâ€”highlight a career dedicated to mastering complex technical domains and leading high-impact initiatives.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve specialized in designing, securing, and optimizing infrastructures for large-scale operations, ensuring theyâ€™re resilient, scalable, and aligned with business goals. My background in process improvement, coupled with an agile mindset and design thinking principles, empowers me to streamline operations and enhance team performance, fostering a culture of innovation and accountability.

While my PMP and project management experience inform my disciplined approach, my focus is on leading technical teams to achieve excellence through hands-on guidance, strategic vision, and continuous improvement. Iâ€™m passionate about creating robust solutions that drive efficiency, growth, and sustainable value.

This portfolio is a curated view of my technical and leadership journey.
