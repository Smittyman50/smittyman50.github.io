## 🧠 About

With over 30 years of experience in IT, I am a technical leader who combines deep expertise in enterprise networking, cybersecurity, and cloud environments with a strategic, results-driven approach. My certifications—including CISSP, AWS, and PMP, along with former CCNP and CCDP credentials—highlight a career dedicated to mastering complex technical domains and leading high-impact initiatives.

Throughout my career, I’ve specialized in designing, securing, and optimizing infrastructures for large-scale operations, ensuring they’re resilient, scalable, and aligned with business goals. My background in process improvement, coupled with an agile mindset and design thinking principles, empowers me to streamline operations and enhance team performance, fostering a culture of innovation and accountability.

While my PMP and project management experience inform my disciplined approach, my focus is on leading technical teams to achieve excellence through hands-on guidance, strategic vision, and continuous improvement. I’m passionate about creating robust solutions that drive efficiency, growth, and sustainable value.

This portfolio is a curated view of my technical and leadership journey.
